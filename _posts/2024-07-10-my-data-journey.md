# Hi there, World!

## I'm Alex! 😎✌️

I’m an experienced data professional with a passion for technology and creating meaningful solutions that unlock the power of data.

Over the years, I’ve had the privilege of helping organizations transform raw data into actionable insights, guiding them to make smarter decisions and achieve impactful results.

## Professional Background

I’ve honed my skills in a variety of data and technology roles, working with tools and platforms like Python, R, SQL and NoSQL databases, AWS, APIs, Tableau, and Power BI. My career journey spans roles such as data analyst, data engineer, and data manager, equipping me with a well-rounded skill set across data engineering, analytics, data science, and machine learning.

I’ve had the opportunity to work for organizations of all sizes—from startups with fewer than 35 employees to enterprises with over 20,000 team members. In each role, I’ve contributed to architecting and optimizing data infrastructure, leading technical initiatives, and delivering insights that drive real impact.

## My Data Journey

My data journey began in a somewhat unexpected way. I studied **Supply Chain Management** and **Economics** in college at the **University of Northern Iowa** and landed my first role thinking I needed to *excel at Excel* just to keep up. As I mastered Excel, I realized that many of my colleagues weren’t as fluent in the tool as I had imagined—and that’s where I found my niche.

I quickly became the go-to person for turning messy data into clear, actionable insights. I loved the process of "crunching numbers" and solving problems. It wasn’t long before I encountered SQL, which opened the door to managing larger datasets more efficiently and sparked my desire to explore even deeper into the world of data.

While I never had a concrete plan for what I wanted to do “when I grew up,” discovering data was a lightbulb moment. I decided to further my skills by enrolling in a master’s program in **Businss Analytics** from the **University of Iowa**, attending night classes while working full-time. This experience introduced me to advanced analytical techniques, programming languages, and the broader possibilities of data science.

That said, I firmly believe that a master’s degree isn’t a requirement for success in data or technology. In fact, the abundance of resources available today—free tutorials, online courses, and structured programs—makes it easier than ever for anyone to start their data journey.

For example, I became a mentor at a data analytics bootcamp, where I helped students pivot into data careers or enhance their current skills. Watching others grow and succeed has been one of the most rewarding aspects of my journey. Programs like these, combined with free learning resources, can be an excellent path for anyone looking to harness the power of data. More about that here: (link to be added)

## A Bit About Me

When I’m not working with data, you’ll likely find me outdoors—biking, hiking, or enjoying nature in any way I can! I also love playing guitar, rocking out to riffs that help me unwind and stay creative.

I’m originally from **Cedar Falls/Waterloo, Iowa**, though my wife’s career as a *traveling histotechnologist* has taken us on an adventure, moving to new places like Portland, Minneapolis, and Toledo. It’s been an exciting way to explore the country while keeping life dynamic.

At home, I’m proud to share life with my amazing wife, our dog, and my trusty guitar. Whether I’m shredding some single track, strumming a melody, or spending time with loved ones, these moments keep me balanced and inspired for my data-driven life.

I hope my story inspires you, whether you're just beginning your data journey or looking for new ways to grow in the field. Let’s connect and share our passion for data! 🚀
