# Hi there, World!

## I'm Alex! üòé‚úåÔ∏è

A data professional with a passion for technology, learning, and building things with good folks!

Over the years, I've had the privilege helping organizations _**harness the power of data**_ in various data roles.

### Professional Background

Over the years, I have honed my skills in data and technology, working with Python, R, SQL and NoSQL databases, AWS, APIs, and business intelligence tools like Tableau and Power BI. My experience includes roles such as data analyst, data engineer, and data manager, equipping me with a versatile skill set and a deep understanding of data engineering, analytics, data science and machine learning. I've worked for large companies of over 15,000, small companies with less than 35 people, and everything in between. I have a proven track record in architecting and optimizing data infrastructure, leading technical initiatives, and delivering actionable insights.

### My Data Journey

My data journey began after my undergraduate studies. While I went to school for Supply Chain Management and Economics, I developed a passion for data and technology in my first role out of college.

Initially, I thought I had to *excel at Excel* to keep up with my colleagues. As I mastered Excel, I realized not many people were as proficient with it and other technologies as I had assumed.

I enjoyed the reputation I was building as the go-to person for organizing messy data into something comprehensible. And it was fun to "crunch" the numbers! After some time on the job, I was introduced to SQL, which sparked my desire to learn more efficient ways to handle bigger and bigger datasets.

I never really knew what I wanted to do when I "grew up". While I'm still not sure I'll ever grow up, I do knew there was something to this data thing!

To further my knowledge, I enrolled in a data analytics master's program at a university in the area, taking night classes while working full-time to fund my education. The program exposed me to advanced analytical concepts, various data techniques, and different programming languages. However, I believe a master's degree isn't necessary for success in technology or data. I started my master's program right before "Data Scienctist" was ranked the number one job on Glass Door and there was not the abundance of learning resources available today.

For example, after I finished my master and sometime in the field, I found a data analytics boot camp that allowed me to become a mentor, helping students switch careers or advance in their current roles. I think programs like these, coupled with the amazing free resources out there, is a great option for someone wanting to better understand how to harness the powers of data.

### A Bit About Me

When I'm not working, I enjoy biking, hiking, or anything that gets me outdoors!

I have a wife, a dog, and a guitar!

Crushing some single track, rocking out some riffs, and spending time with loved one's helped me stay balanced and inspired for this data life!

I am orginally from NorthEast Iowa, but have been moving around through my wife's job. She is a traveling histotechnologist and takes 3 month - o
