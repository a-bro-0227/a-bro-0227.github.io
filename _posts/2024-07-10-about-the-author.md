# Hi there, World!

## I'm Alex! ðŸ˜„

I am an experienced data professional who has held various data roles throughout my career. What began as overestimating colleagues' Excel abilities in the office has evolved into a passion for data, allowing me to work remotely and travel across the US.

### Professional Background

Over the years, I have honed my skills in data and technology, working with Python, R, SQL and NoSQL databases, AWS, APIs, and business intelligence tools like Tableau and Power BI. My experience includes roles such as data analyst, data engineer, and data manager, equipping me with a versatile skill set and a deep understanding of data engineering, analytics, and data science. I've worked for large companies of over 15,000, small companies with less than 35 people, and everything in between. I have a proven track record in architecting and optimizing data infrastructure, leading technical initiatives, and delivering actionable insights.

### My Data Journey

My data journey began after my undergraduate studies when I developed a passion for data and technology. Initially, I thought I had to excel at Excel to keep up with my colleagues. As I mastered Excel, I realized not many people were as proficient with it and other technologies as I had assumed.

I enjoyed the reputation I was building as the go-to person for organizing messy data into something comprehensible. And it was fun to "crunch" the numbers. After some time on the job, I was introduced to SQL, which sparked my desire to learn more efficient ways to handle bigger and bigger datasets.

To further my knowledge, I enrolled in a data analytics master's program at a university in the area, taking night classes while working full-time to fund my education. The program exposed me to advanced analytical concepts, various data techniques, and different programming languages. However, I believe a master's degree isn't necessary for success in this field. I started my master's program right before "Data Scienctist" was ranked the number one job on Glass Door and there was not the abundance of learning resources available today.

After I finished my master and sometime in the field, I found a data analytics boot camp that allowed me to become a mentor, helping students switch careers or advance in their current roles. I truly enjoyed teaching others and hope this blog can continue to fulfill that passion.

### A Bit About Me

When I'm not working, I enjoy biking, hiking, or anything that gets me outdoors! I also have a wife, a dog, and a guitar! Whether it's crushing some downhill dirt single track or rocking out some riffs, these activities help me stay balanced and inspired.
