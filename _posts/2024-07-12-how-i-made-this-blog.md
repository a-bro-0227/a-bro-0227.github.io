# First, Why A Blog?

If you're like me, it can be helpful to read a blog from a real person with real experience in a subject you are curious about. Like many other mediums on the internet, a blog can help you learn something new or see something from a different perspective.

I thought creating my own blog would not only provide an outlet for organizing my projects and technology tangents but also offer others the opportunity to stumble across, hopefully, something helpful.

# Configuring This Blog

If you know [about me](https://a-bro-0227.github.io/about-the-author), you know I have a background in technology and data science. Given my experience, I knew setting up a blog couldn't be that difficult since there are so many blogs out there from people with no tech experience (food blogs, travel blogs, etc.).

However, like any project, it requires some research, time, and effort. I wanted something free, something I could configure programmatically, but something relatively easy to set up.

That is when I came across GitHub Pages!

## Why GitHub Pages?

It's 

GitHub Pages is a static site hosting service designed to host your personal or organization pages directly from a GitHub repository. It's free, easy to use, and integrates seamlessly with your existing GitHub projects. Here are some key benefits:

- Cost-Effective: GitHub Pages is completely free.
- Ease of Use: You can deploy your site directly from your GitHub repository.
- Custom Domain: You can use your own domain name if you prefer.
- Community and Support: There's a vast community and plenty of documentation available to help you get started.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into setting up your blog with GitHub Pages, here are a few prerequisites:

1. GitHub Account: You'll need a GitHub account. If you don't have one, you can sign up [here](https://github.com/).
2. Basic Understanding of Git: Familiarity with Git and GitHub will be helpful. There are plenty of resources available to get you up to speed if you're new to these tools.
3. Markdown Knowledge: Knowing how to write in Markdown will make it easier to format your blog posts. Markdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents. It's easy to use when you start to understand the [syntax](https://github.com/lifeparticle/Markdown-Cheatsheet).
4. Text Editor: Any text editor will do, but some popular ones include VS Code, Sublime Text, or even GitHub's own web-based editor.
